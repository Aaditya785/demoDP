Tax and GST (Goods and Services Tax) are both forms of revenue collection by governments, but they differ in scope, structure, and application:

1. **Definition**:
   - **Tax**: A broad term referring to compulsory financial charges imposed by governments on individuals, businesses, or transactions to fund public services and infrastructure. Taxes can be direct (e.g., income tax) or indirect (e.g., sales tax).
   - **GST**: A specific type of indirect tax levied on the supply of goods and services. It is a value-added tax (VAT) system designed to replace multiple indirect taxes with a single, unified tax.

2. **Scope**:
   - **Tax**: Encompasses various forms, including income tax, corporate tax, property tax, sales tax, excise duty, and customs duty.
   - **GST**: Focuses solely on the consumption of goods and services, applying at each stage of the supply chain but allowing for input tax credits to avoid double taxation.

3. **Structure**:
   - **Tax**: Can be progressive, proportional, or regressive, depending on the type (e.g., income tax is often progressive, while sales tax is regressive).
   - **GST**: Typically a flat or multi-rate system applied uniformly across goods and services, with exemptions or lower rates for essential items.

4. **Application**:
   - **Tax**: Collected at different points (e.g., income tax at earnings, sales tax at purchase).
   - **GST**: Collected at every stage of production and distribution, with businesses claiming credits for taxes paid on inputs, ensuring only the final consumer bears the tax burden.

5. **Purpose**:
   - **Tax**: Used for general government revenue, redistributing wealth, and influencing economic behavior.
   - **GST**: Aims to simplify the tax system, reduce cascading effects, and create a unified market by replacing multiple indirect taxes.

In summary, tax is a broader concept covering various types of levies, while GST is a specific, consumption-based tax designed to streamline indirect taxation.
